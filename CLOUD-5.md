## HTML5-based computer music system with Csound, CsoundAC, and Strudel by Michael Gogins. 

Welcome to _cloud-5_, a system for making computer music purely in the 
HTML5 environment!

cloud-5 runs on every system that has audio output, that can run any kind of 
Web server, and that has any standards compliant Web browser. 

That includes _all_ computers running macOS, Linux, or Windows, most Android 
devices, and many single-board computers such as Raspberry Pi, BeagleBoard, 
Bela, and Norns.

cloud-5 is based on my Web site of computer music pieces, cloud-music.

## Getting Started

### Pre-requisites

 - A Web server that will run from a configurable directory in which you can 
   read, edit, and write files.
   
 - A standards-compliant Web browser (currently, that includes nearly all Web 
   browsers).
   
 - A text or code editor for writing your compositions.
   
 - Of course, an audio system that can play audio from Web browsers!

### Installation

There is no installation! 

Just copy the entire cloud-5 directory and all contents to your computer or 
device. Make sure you can read, edit, and write files in the cloud-5 
directory.

### Configuration

There is no configuration!

Well, actually there is one thing. You must configure your Web server to serve 
files from the cloud-5 directory.

### Running

 1. Start your Web server.

 2. Start your Web browser and go to your configured address (usually just 
    something like `https://localhost:8000`).

 3. You should see a directory listing. Click on `cloud_music_no_1.html` and 
    verify that you see animated graphics, and can play and hear the piece.

### Making Music

In cloud-5, musical compositions are written as Web pages, i.e. .html 
files.

It's a good idea for each composition to be written as just one .html file.

There are many ways to write compositions, because the capabilities of 
Csound, Strudel, and HTML5 are so vast.

Start out by a making a copy of the one provided examples, and editing it 
to suit your own purposes.
