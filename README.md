Music in the cloud by Michael Gogins. 

This is real music. Each piece will play indefinitely in any standard Web browser. There may or may not be animated visuals along with the music. The listener may or may not be able to customize the piece -- perhaps quite a bit, amounting to a new piece, co-composed with me.

All source code for these pieces is available in the GitHub repository.

The underlying technology is my WebAssembly builds of Csound and CsoundAC. Some pieces may use third party libraries.
