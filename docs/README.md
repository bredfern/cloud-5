This is real music. But it is not a streaming recording. It is not performed 
in a concert. The pieces are Web pages that are loaded from my Web server and 
run in your browser -- in _any_ standard Web browser, including mobile devices 
(at least, if they are powerful enough).

Each piece will play indefinitely. There may or may not be animated visuals 
along with the music. The listener may or may not be able to customize the 
piece -- perhaps quite a bit, amounting to a new piece, co-composed with me.

All source code for these pieces is available in my GitHub repository.

The underlying technology is my WebAssembly build of Csound with CsoundAC. 
Some pieces use third party libraries.
