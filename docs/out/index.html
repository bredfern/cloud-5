            <div class="description"><p>Cycler implements real-time and/or &quot;always-on&quot; score generation for
cloud-music, a 100% HTML5 environment for computer music and algorithmic
composition.</p>
<p>Cycler is <em>very</em> loosely inspired by Tidal Cycles. However, Cycler is not
designed for live coding. Instead, the purpose is to adapt existing
CsoundAC score generation and transformation facilities, especially the
chord space stuff, to indefinite, real-time looping in the HTML5
environment.</p>
<h2>Algorithm</h2>
<p>Cycler is concerned only with generating and processing Events; these are
numerical vectors that correspond directly to Csound &quot;i&quot; statements,
usually notes. (As for control signals, they can either be generated
within Csound instruments, or sent to Csound from JavaScript via
<code>Csound.setChannelValue</code>.)</p>
<p>Another difference is that whereas Tidal Cycles resolves every note to its
own leaf node in the rendering graph, here any node, even leaf nodes, may
contain processes or scores that produce multiple notes.</p>
<p>The basic idea is that a composition is a directed acyclic graph of Nodes:
the base Node class, a Stack, a Rest, or a Cycle. Any Node may optionally
generate Events and/or transform Events. Each Node has an associated
duration that may be set in several different ways. A base Node performs
its immediate child Nodes in sequence, in order of insertion. A Stack
performs its immediate child Nodes simultaneously. A Cycle repeats its
child Nodes (of any kind) either indefinitely, or for a fixed number of
times. There is also a Rest node that adds a silent Node to a sequence.
Only Cycles actually schedule and render Events. Therefore, every
composition must include at least one Cycle; but a composition may include
multiple Cycles, which can repeat at differing intervals.</p>
<p>Compositions are by no means limited to unvarying repetitions of one
cycle. Not only may multiple cycles run at different intervals to produce
differential canons and other temporal structures, but the score
generators and processors that the composer defines in Nodes can use
chance operations and/or chaos, or even modify the graph of the piece as
it performs.</p>
<p>As a Cycle repeats, it resets its cycle time to 0 and recursively
generates and/or transforms Events from the bottom of its graph of Nodes
up to the root of the graph. Each Node has a Score into which Events are
generated and within which Events are transformed. The Scores of child
Nodes are appended to the Score of their parent node, and so on,
recursively. The Node durations propagate from the bottom of the
graph up, with optional rescaling, but the current cycle time is
propagated from the root at the top of the graph down, and is used to
schedule the different Scores in sync with the master timing of the Cycle.</p>
<p>In addition to this recursive subdivision of cycle time, each Node fits
all Events generated by itself and its child Nodes into its alloted
duration. The duration of the child Node may be left independent of the
parent Node, or the duration of the parent may be expanded to match the
duration of the child, or the duration of the child may be squeezed to
match the duration of the parent.</p></div>
